-- ds.h2: Working remotely as a digital nomad in Honduras

-- ds.markdown:

Roatan is a dream for digital nomads. A pristine Caribbean island off the coast
of Honduras, Roatan offers a relaxed pace of life combined with different
activities. The island is home to canopied jungles, white sandy beaches, and
spectacular diving. Scuba diving shops line the shore at West End, and the
freediving school regularly hosts world championships. Aside from its natural
gifts, the Honduran locals are laid-back and welcoming, and the cost of living
is not too high for remote workers. Altogether, coworking in Roatan is a
must-do for the sun-seeking nomad.

There's currently no digital nomad visa for Honduras, but there are 84 countries
whose nationals can stay for 90 days without a visa. Those not on the list will
have to apply for a tourist visa. Make sure you have proof of onward travel to
enter the country either way. There is also an international airport on the
island, giving easy access to travelers.

Honduras was the last stop on my Dream Job campaign trip, and my favorite. It
was a chance to slow down and enjoy the little moments. I made a few good local
friends, while also training intently to reach a new personal best in
freediving.

I stayed in the fun, backpacker/diver area of Roatan, West End. The cabin I
rented was surrounded by nature, just two minutes from the beach. I didn’t know
it was the party zone, but it was very quiet in my accommodation. Perks of West
End include easy access to nightlife, dive shops, coffee shops and the most
diverse dining on the island. It’s also a lot cheaper than the fancier West
Bay. The price of food and Airbnbs is always higher there, so I wouldn’t
recommend it for a long-term stay. You can take a water taxi or collectivo taxi
to that area for only a few dollars.

`Activities in Roatan`

Whether you’re into scuba diving, snorkeling or freediving, Roatan is one of the
best places in the world to explore the ocean. The reefs just outside West Bay
and West End would be the best most travelers have seen. I had my most
productive week of freediving training there, with crystal clear waters and
warm temperatures even in the off-season. I nearly always had sightings of big
fish while I was training, which just goes to show how rich the marine life is
there. 

But if diving isn’t your thing, there are still gorgeous beaches on the Bay
islands to explore, and jungle eco-adventures like zip lining. The local
chocolate factories are also well worth the visit.

It couldn’t have been more effortless training in the mornings, grabbing a local
breakfast for $3 (baleadas), then heading to the Beach Desk coworking space to
work.

Along with fast Wifi and great amenities, Beach Desk had incredible views of the
ocean. It was the perfect place for remote work on the island. The community is
great and I was lucky to meet many expats and entrepreneurs there during my
trip. In the evenings, either my freediving friends or coworking colleagues
would have events organized. Networking and making friends was exceptionally
easy here. On top of that, the locals were incredibly social, and I felt like I
knew everyone on the main street after a week. I also never felt unsafe walking
alone at night, and everyone I met was genuinely awesome.

-- ds.h2: Wrap-Up: Life as a Digital Nomad in Roatan

-- ds.markdown:

While a carefree island life might not appeal to all, it’s an absolute dream for
most. In Roatan, you’ll find the world-class Caribbean beaches and island
lifestyle of your dreams. Central America, in general, has been rapidly gaining
popularity amongst digital nomads since the pandemic. When you’re not out
exploring the vibrant reefs or engaging in other year-round activities on the
island, you can work a stone’s throw from the water with fast and reliable
Wifi. In short, it’s a paradise, and one of my favorite locations so far to be
a digital nomad.
